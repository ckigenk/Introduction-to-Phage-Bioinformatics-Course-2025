# Introduction-to-Phage-Bioinformatics-Course-2025
Welcome to the **Introduction to Phage Bioinformatics Course 2025** repository! This repository contains the lectures, datasets and other material for phage bioinformatics course

## Course Overview
### Dates: February 17 - 28, 2025
### Location: Technical University of Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya

This course is designed to introduce students, researchers, and enthusiasts to the fundamental concepts and tools of phage bioinformatics. The course will cover topics such as:

- Introduction to phage biology
- Phage Genome Sequencing
- Assembly and Annotation of phage genomes
- Comparative genomics
- Online tools

By the end of the course, participants will be equipped with the skills to conduct bioinformatic analysis on phage genomes and contribute to the growing field of phage research.
